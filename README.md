# Sign Language AI 
Computers can speak sign language, too! 

My sister is obsessed with sign language, so she gave me the idea to try to teach a computer sign language! The full story is available on my 
[projects blog](projects.rajshrimali.com). 

In short, I 
- Used Tensorflow w/Python to create a Convolutional Net to learn sign language 
- Got the dataset from Kaggle 
- Had to use Google Cloud Compute to do the computing because my laptop didn't have a graphics card.
